## Setup

### Requirement
Required python version: Python 2.7

Required python libraries: Tensorflow (>=1.0) + Scipy + Numpy + Pillow.

Tested in Ubuntu + Intel i7 CPU + Nvidia Titan X (Pascal) with Cuda (>=8.0) and CuDNN (>=5.0). CPU mode should also work with minor changes.

### Quick Start (Testing)
1. Clone this repository.
2. Download the VGG19 pretrained model by running "python download_models.py".
3. Download the pretrained model from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wO0MwWOM8kVOw-nlDlO1yizYa_PlVcO6/view?usp=sharing) and extract at the root directory
3. Run "test.py" to synthesize images.
4. The synthesized images are saved in "gta_demo/result/"

### Training

#### Dataset
You can download the pre-processed dataset from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/104WWj0ygWVNRg_KmuUW3EDu_ymEukz4U/view?usp=sharing) or you can download it from the official [website](https://download.visinf.tu-darmstadt.de/data/from_games/) and run "python preprocess.py" to process the images.

#### Pretraining
We train our model based on the CRN pretrained model. The pre-processed model (extra channels are added) can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mt7ZS4zyECrqcDwWjqryjPFdc0gsFcqs/view?usp=sharing). You can also download the CRN pretrained model from their [project](https://github.com/CQFIO/PhotographicImageSynthesis) and then preprocess the model by running "python preprocess_crn_model.py".

#### Rarity estimation
Once you have downloaded the dataset, you can generate the rarity mask (for loss rebalancing) and rarity bins (for dataset rebalancing) by running "python gen_dataset_weight.py" or you can download the pre-generated ones from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qzkcOKxoVzg5UTFeCXzcvRPCpLAOQMfI/view?usp=sharing)

#### Run
Run "python train.py" to start training
